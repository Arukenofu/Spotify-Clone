## Instructions

### Install dependencies

I use npm as a package manager. Some package managers should work too.

```bash
npm install
```

### Setting environment variables
Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=BACKEND_URL
```

### Open the application

Now you can run `npm run dev` to start the app and open http://localhost:5173 with your browser to see the result. Yappi! üéâ
