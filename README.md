# Spotify Clone

`Spotify Clone` application developed by [Bauyrzhan Alkenov](https://github.com/Arukenofu).

## Instructions

### Install dependencies

I use npm as a package manager. Some package managers should work too.

```bash
npm install
```

### Setting environment variables
Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```bash
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=Your Spotify Client ID
VITE_REDIRECT_TARGET=Your Spotify Redirect Target
```

Create your own spotify app via [spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)

### Open the application

Now you can run `npm run dev` to start the app and open http://localhost:5173 with your browser to see the result. Yappi! ðŸŽ‰

## Purpose

This project was developed as a learning exercise to deepen my understanding of web development. It demonstrates my ability to build complex applications and serves as a showcase of my technical capabilities for potential employers.
